  blurb:
    "My role at Brainnwave has been using Typescript to build up a component library to implement the company's design system provided from Figma. I integrated the library into a React SaaS platform for report building. I programmed a dynamic data visualisation builder using Cube JS to pull data from the Postgres database and then displayed charts using the Apache Echarts library. I integrated with the backend storage solution using Directus for CMS management. Iâ€™ve gained a better understanding of building scalable client systems as well as a deeper understanding of the react ecosystem using tools such as storybook to visualise and develop components. My role with Hatch was primarily to facilitate continuing to work with Brainnwave after having moved to Canada.",

    "I developed an ETL monitoring dashboard using React to implement the frontend, Springboot to build the backend and Maria DB as a database.
